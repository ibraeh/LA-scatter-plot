# Title & Introduction
- **Title:**  [Crime Location Distribution](https://ibraeh.github.io/LA-scatter-plot/HTML/index.html) 
- **Introduction:** A scatter plot to identify crime patterns or clusters in the areas of reported crime. It analyzed different crimes committed in Los Angeles from 2020 to the present. 

# Project Description
* **Functionality:** A scatter plot  designed with d3.js having the following functionalities: tooltip, brushing, zooming, panning, responsive axes, filtering, and interactive legend. 
* **Technology and tools:** This project leveraged d3.js version 7 to create a fully interactive scatter plot with features like tooltips, brushing for data selection, zooming, panning, and responsive axes. Additionally, VS Code was used as the development platform, while jQuery and Bootstrap were utilized to enhance user interaction and responsiveness across different screen sizes.
 

# Dataset
* **Data Source:** The dataset was obtained from Kaggle via the link [Crime Data From 2020 to Present](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhamgupta012/crime-data-from-2020-to-present).
* **Data Format:** The data was in CSV format.

# Data Exploration Insights
* **Spatial distribution of crimes:**
The visualization enabled spatial distribution of crime across geographical regions, making identifying areas with low or high crime rates easy.
* **Hotspots and Coldspots:**
Clusters of data points in an area indicated a high concentration of crime, Hotspots. Likewise, locations with few or no data points represented low concentration of crime, Coldspots. 
* **Comparative Analysis:**
Users could easily use the visualization to compare crime patterns across different geographical locations.


# Responsiveness
The visualization was responsive and adaptable to various screen sizes. It also had different functionalities to aid user interaction and usability.

# Future Works
To include and enhance the interactive features. To provide more accessibility options.
